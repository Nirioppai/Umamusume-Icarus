"""Trackblazer decision core for the Trackblazer scenario.

A clean implementation of the reference Trackblazer decision model (a
scoring-shared training scorer plus the Campaign/Trackblazer waterfall), ported
to run on Icarus's exact game-API data.

This is the DEFAULT and ONLY engine. When active, it FULLY OWNS the per-turn
training/rest/mood/recreation decision. The dormant legacy ("Classic") scorer
(``_score_command`` / ``_best_command`` / race-vs-train gates) that used to live
in mant.py has been removed; ``decision_mode`` values "legacy"/"classic"/"android"
are accepted as backward-compatible aliases for this engine.

Build status (incremental):
  * STEP 1 (this module): training scorer + per-distance targets + milestone
    phasing + the train/rest/mood/recreation/medic + summer/finale/energy
    waterfall. Racing: honors truly-mandatory races and applies the reference
    Trackblazer energy/consecutive-race guards, then defers WHICH-race selection
    to the existing RacePlanner (data-only helper reuse, not legacy decision
    logic).
  * STEP 3: race selection layers the prediction gate on top of the MILP
    solver using the race_entry peek (race_horse_data popularity marks).

All math mirrors the reference training scorer; every constant is inline and
overridable via mant_config so it stays tunable.
