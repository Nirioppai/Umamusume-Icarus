# SweepyModv5.37 AI Previous Log Import

SweepyModv5.37 adds an **Import Previous Logs** control to the AI Learning modal.

Accepted sources:

- an older SweepyMod build folder, such as `C:\UmamusumeChatGPT\SweepyModv5.33`
- an older `uma_runtime` folder
- an older `bot_logs` folder
- a zip containing any of the above

The importer only reads gameplay learning data:

- `career_log_*.json`
- `race_outcomes.json`
- `events_seen.json`

Auth files, Steam tokens, account config, and unrelated runtime files are ignored.

After import, SweepyMod rebuilds the AI dataset and can immediately train the local advisor. Repeated imports are hash-deduplicated through `uma_runtime/default/ai/import_manifest.json`.

## Easier long-term option

For future upgrades, the simplest migration is to copy the whole old `uma_runtime/default` folder into the new build before launching, or paste the old build folder path into the Import Previous Logs field after launching.
